/* Data Structures: Non-Linear Data Structures (Graphs)
 * A graph consists of two sets v and e where, v is a finite, non-empty "set of vertices"
   and e is a "set of pairs of vertices".
 * The pairs of vertices are called "edges".
 * A graph can be of two types: "Undirected graph" and "Directed graph".
 * The most commonly used representations for graphs are "Adjacency matrices" and "Adjacency lists".
 * Given the "root node" of a binary tree, one of the most common operations performed is "visiting every node
   of the tree in some order".
 * Similarly, given a "vertex" in a directed or undirected graph "we may wish to visit all vertices
   in the graph that are reachable from this vertex".
 * This can be done in two waysâ€”using the "Depth First Search" and the "Breadth First Search" algorithm.
